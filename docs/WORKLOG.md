## Step 1 - Assignment Interpretation

The assignment requires more than fixing a bug. It asks for a complete investigation workflow: reverse engineering, graph representation, Obsidian documentation, agentic debugging, token-efficiency comparison, and before/after proof.

## Step 2 - Scope Selection

A compact scheduler bug was selected because it is small enough to fully document but still contains meaningful architecture: parsing, domain objects, dependency validation, topological ordering, and schedule calculation.

## Step 3 - Reverse Engineering

The upstream snapshot mixed parsing, dependency validation, and insertion in a single loop. Graph navigation made `parse_plan` the central hot node because scheduler correctness depended on parser output.

## Step 4 - Bug Reproduction

The failure case was a forward dependency. A valid task plan failed only because row order placed the dependency after the dependent task.

## Step 5 - Fix and Enhancement

The parser was redesigned into a two-pass flow: parse all tasks, validate dependencies, then build the plan. This is both a bug fix and a design improvement because validation no longer depends on input ordering.

## Step 6 - Evidence

Unit tests, graph output, Obsidian pages, and reports were added to make the reasoning auditable.

## Step 7 - Gemini Agent Evidence

A Gemini-backed agent path was added after reviewing the token-efficiency requirement. The project now measures the actual prompt packet sent to the AI agent and persists successful API responses as JSON and Markdown reports. README screenshots show the terminal execution.
